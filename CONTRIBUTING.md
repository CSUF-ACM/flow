Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing!

There are many ways to contribute to the project: logging [bugs](https://github.com/flow-thru/flowthru/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=), submitting [pull requests](https://github.com/flow-thru/flowthru/pulls), reporting [issues](https://github.com/flow-thru/flowthru/issues), and creating [suggestions](https://github.com/flow-thru/flowthru/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=).

The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved. If you would like more detail on how you can contribute, please read through the [flowthru wiki](https://github.com/flow-thru/flowthru/wiki)

## Asking Questions

Have a question? Rather than opening an issue, we encourage you to ask in the [Flowthru Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/flowthru/shared_invite/enQtNjYxMDM2Nzc5NDkzLTJiZTU0NGQ0ZTc0NjRjNDMxNDY4ODU0YzA4MTUwZTU5YmMyZTAyZmFiMjY4ZWFkNzI5MDYxMTUyMTY0Mjc3MTQ). This is the hub for all general discussion and "how-to" questions.

## Providing Feedback

Your comments and feedback are extremely important to us!

Please refer to out [Feedback Channels](https://github.com/flow-thru/flowthru/wiki/Feedback-Channels) section of out wiki to learn how you can share your thoughts.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a bug? Would you like to request a feature? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* üëç - upvote
* üëé - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

When creating an issue, please utilize the proper [template](https://github.com/flow-thru/flowthru/issues/new/choose) and fill out the presented fields in the description box and apply the proper [labeling](https://github.com/flow-thru/flowthru/wiki/Issue-Tracking)

### Follow Your Issue

Once submitted, your report will go into our workflow. Your issue can take on multiple paths: it can be put on the roadmap, put on the current milestone, or be backlogged. To fully understand what will happen next, so you know what to expect, read through the [Development Process](https://github.com/flow-thru/flowthru/wiki/Development-Process) section of the wiki.
